        Precipitation Topics Glossaries icon Weather portal vte Weather is the
        state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree to which it
        is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy.[1] On
        Earth, most weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the planet's
        atmosphere, the troposphere,[2][3] just below the stratosphere. Weather
        refers to day-to-day temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric
        conditions, whereas climate is the term for the averaging of atmospheric
        conditions over longer periods of time.[4] When used without
        qualification, "weather" is generally understood to mean the weather of
        Earth.
